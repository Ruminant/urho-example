# Urho-Example

An extremely stripped down URHO3D example.  You'll need

1. Urho3D installed
2. An environment variable which tells us where Urho3D is installed (URHO3D_HOME, e.g. `c:\bin\urho3d`)
3. An environment variable which gives us the path to the resources (URHO3D_PATH_PREFIX, e.g. `c:\bin\urho3d;c:\bin\urho3d\resources`)
4. CMake :)

When run, all you get to see is a big "Hello, World"... Press `ESCAPE` to quit.
